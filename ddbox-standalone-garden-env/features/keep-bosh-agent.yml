# This ops file keeps the BOSH Agent up. Otherwise, standard BOSH-Lite
# manifests have it stopped/killed after 5 minutes.
#
# Keeping the BOSH Agent up, means the TCP sockets 127.0.0.1:2825 (bosh-agent
# protocol) and 0.0.0.0:6868 (nats message bus) are kept listening.
#
# Here, as port 6868 is not exposed to the outside Internet world in the
# 'ddbox-env' context, we can keep those ports open.
#
# This should improve how successive 'bosh create-env' perform. Indeed, when
# the agent is stopped, all subsequent 'bosh create-env' can't assess the
# state of the VM. So, they just assume the VM is in some random junk state,
# delete it, and re-create it.
#
# Instead, when 'bosh create-env' can assess the VM state, it might VM
# converge it towards its desired state nicely, which is the expected feature
# in the first place.
