    # The 'outbound-network' option below enables a 'NAT' network to be
    # defined in order for the Vitrualbox environment to expose TCP ports to
    # the outside Internet world. Indeed 'vip' networks are not supported by
    # the VirtualBox CPI.
    #
    # For a concrete example of a 'NAT' network that the Virtualbox CPI uses
    # to expose TCP ports, see the 'enable-vbox-port-forwarding' ops file.
    #
    # The limitation with 'outbound-network' is that when Virtualbox is run by
    # a non-root user (which is recommended for security reasons), then ports
    # below the 1024 threshold cannot be exposed, which is inconvenient for
    # usual HTTP(S) ports like 80 and 443.
    #
    # This 'outbound-network' requires the 'outbound_network_name' variable to
    # be set to 'NatNetwork' below. Other values wouldn't let you expose
    # ports, which is the main value here.
    #

    # The 'remote' option is essential for driving a distant Virtualbox
    # environment.
    #
    # Requires 'vbox_host', 'vbox_username' and 'vbox_ssh.private_key' to be
    # set below or in the 'private.yml' file with restricted permissions. See
    # example below.
