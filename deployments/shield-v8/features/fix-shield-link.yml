# Workaround for SHIELD core not exposing the correct IP in its 'shield' link.
#
# This is also due to the ddbox networking topology, that is still not able to
# route traffic from internal networks through the load balancer public IP and
# then back to internal networks without some specific iptables rules on the
# Garden VM.
