# In BOSH-Lite, docker will refuse to start when no persistent disk is present
# on the instance.
# The error message mentions something about some "graphdriver".
# This has been observed with Docker BOSH Release v35.3.4 and Xenial Stemcell
# v621.71.

# Sanity tests require docker, and thus we are forced to add a persistent disk
# to the ephemeral VM.
