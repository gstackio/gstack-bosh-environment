# Here we face a chicken-and-egg problem, because the 'ctl' script of the
# 'minio-server' job is creating the DNS alias _and_ using it for Minio
# servers to join one another.
#
# So, creating an alias in the runtime-config should be favord over setting
# the 'dns_alias' property below (at least until this is fixed in the Minio
# BOSH Release). Both ways are producing the exact same result anyway.
#
# - path: /instance_groups/name=minio/jobs/name=minio-server/properties/dns_alias?
#   type: replace
#   value: ((minio_internal_hostname))


# Even considering the above remark about the 'dns_alias' property, adding the
# DNS alias as a TLS alternative name (below) is still perfectly appropriate.
