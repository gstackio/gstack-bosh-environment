  # User-facing settings

  # (none)


  # Tweaks

  # NOTE: the following tweaks depend on the 'log-cache-bosh-lite.yml'
  # ops-file. They have been established on cf-deployment v6.10.0, and need to
  # be re-evaluated with more recent version.
  #
  # # This setting depends on the total RAM size allocated to the Garden VM.
  # # Example: 1% of the total 24GB RAM means 240MB max.
  # # See also: the 'scale-vm-size.yml' ops file for the Garden VM.
  # log_cache_memory_limit_percent: 1
  # # Issue: it turns out that even with 1% of 24GB RAM, log-cache still
  # # consumes 2.7GB RAM (11.4%) or resident memory, which is way too much
  # # compared to what's expected. So we lower the setting below from 100k to
  # # 10k.
  # log_cache_max_per_source: 10000 # 100000
  # # A possible workaround to this excessive memory consumption could be
  # # disabling 'log-cache'. But it still ends up consuming 1.6GB anyway, which
  # # is 6.5% of total Garden VM RAM.
  # log_cache_disabled: true
  # # => Still consumes 3.2GB of resident memory, which are 13.6% of our 23.9GB
  # # memory VM.
