  # Tweaks

  # This setting depends on the total RAM size allocated to the Garden VM.
  # Example: 1% of the total 24GB RAM means 240MB max.
  # See also: the 'scale-vm-size.yml' ops file for the Garden VM.
  log_cache_memory_limit_percent: 1
  # Issue: it turns out that even with 1% of 24GB RAM, log-cache still
  # consumes 2.7GB RAM (11.4%) or resident memory, which is way too much
  # compared to what's expected. So we lower the setting below from 100k to
  # 10k.
  log_cache_max_per_source: 10000 # 100000
  # Finally, the only workaround to this excessive memory consumption is to
  # disable 'log-cache'.
